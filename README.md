# browserstack-screenshots
generate-screenshots.py

**A script to generate Browserstack screenshots from a list of client IDs where the base URL is the same for all.**

I used this script to generate a gallery of screenshots for a lot of clients using Browserstacks and Selenium.

The script depends on a .csv file in the same directory containing a list of client IDs and client names. Check the client.csv file for an example.
